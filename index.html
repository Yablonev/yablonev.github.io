            <h2><span>What's my background?</span> 🧶</h2>

            <p>
              From 2012 to 2015, I was developing games in <span class="anchor anchor--purple state--activated">Unity3D</span>, created several pet projects for PC and Android.
              At the same time, I acquired a developer account on the Play Market and published an application the essence of which was to let people train typing speed on a mobile phone.
              This application scored about 10 thousand installations and generated about 30k ad views. The application was in Russian and English and had installations from various countries.
              After that I became interested in Web development.
            </p>
            <p>
                Having studied Web Programming, I got a job in 2017 at international outsourcing <a href="https://www.digitaledge.net" target="_blank">IT company based in New York</a> and worked there for about 2 years as a web developer and performed tasks both in frontend and backend. While working, I programmed in various languages: in Vue.js and Typescript while i was working on a project <a href="https://www.marchofdimes.org/" target="_blank">marchofdimes</a> (large American charity fund), over a large PHP project (shopelot online store on the Amazon API Amazon), performed many typesetting tasks, including doing layout for <a href="https://www.digitaledge.net" target="_blank">Digital Edge index page</a>, and also <a href="https://www.digitaledge.net/career" target="_blank">career page</a> and many others, while working I had a lot of practice working with a variety of huge legacy projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                I wrote more than a dozen chatbots for VK, worked with CRON, wrote parsers, I have experience working with the API of various services including Yandex, VK, Google Firebase, Amazon, ORC, and so on.
                I created and published several extensions for Google Chrome and have a little experience in creating programs on Electron. I am interested in neural networks and cryptocurrencies. I am able to work with databases, git and terminal and with different technical software,
                as well as trello, slack and other task managers. I am interested in the topics of cybersecurity and hacking. By this token I am a member of the closed «VKontakte» testing group. <mark>Additionally, I do web design, I know how to work in Photoshop and Sketch. I watch a lot of content about IT and at the same time constantly improve in writing code and other skills.</mark>
            </p>
            <!-- <p>
                There are several I created from scratch and published <a href="https://www.dappocean.io/ru/dapps/russianroulette" target="_blank">gambling</a> projects on the Waves blockchain and also <a href="https://waves-game.ru/2the/moon" target="_blank">several</a> in development. In addition to this, I created a couple of large enough <a href="https://рф.site/themeforest/topich/demo/index" target="_blank">templates</a>
                «Admin dashboard» для Themeforest (Envato). I tried to do my various projects, <a href="https://10rub.site/instagram/random" target="_blank">here is one of them</a>, quite simple and I realized it in less than a day, from the idea to the first sale! There were attempts to do <a href="https://книги.pw/" target="_blank">such a project</a> it is a pity that the hypothesis with the sale of books by subscription was not very popular :( Of these pet projects, I have <a href="https://site-icons.ru/" target="_blank">website with icons</a>, <a href="https://рф.site/create" target="_blank">site builder</a> and dozens of others, I think it makes no sense to bring all. In addition to programming, I also like to do UX tasks, as well work on email newsletters.

                  I would rather like to get a job as a front-end developer, but I also don't mind doing back-end tasks if necessary, also I don't mind creating HTML layout. I would like to have 2 days off. I don't really like pointless meetings or pair coding. I also prefer to work on a product, not an outsourcing company. The size of the company or the team is not important to me, I do not mind working in a startup or in an enterprise company. My time zone is GMT + 0 (I live in Portugal). The technology stack of the project is desirable to at least partially coincide with my skills. I want to get more experience working in modern IT companies and in working on non-trivial tasks. Consider only remote work.
